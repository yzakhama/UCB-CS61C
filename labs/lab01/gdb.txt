1. While you’re in a gdb session, how do you set the arguments that will be passed to the program when it’s run?
    (gdb) set args arg1 arg2 arg3
    (gdb) show args
    (gdb) run

2. How do you create a breakpoint?
    (gdb) break main
    (gdb) break 42 <- line
    (gdb) break 42 if x > 10
    (gdb) delete 1

3. How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
    (gdb) next  <- step over
    (gdb) n
    (gdb) nexti <- next instruction (assembly)

    (gdb) step  <- step into function calls
    (gdb) stepi

4. If the next line of code is a function call, you’ll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3.
   (If not, consider a different command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function (i.e. step into the function) instead?
   (If you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)
        see #3

5. How do you continue the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
    (gdb) continue
    (gdb) c

6. How can you print the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
    (gdb) print variable
    (gdb) p variable
    (gdb) p 1 + 2
    (gdb) print myStruct.field <- Print a struct field
    (gdb) print *ptr           <- Print through a pointer
    (gdb) display x            <- Automatically print every time it changes

7. How do you configure gdb so it displays the value of a variable after every step?
    (gdb) display x
    (gdb) display i + j  <- Display expressions

    (gdb) info display   <- List all displays
    (gdb) undisplay 1    <- Delete a display

8. How do you show a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
    (gdb) info locals   <- Lists all local variables in the current function
                           Shows their current values (if initialized)
                           Does not show global or static variables

    (gdb) info globals
    (gdb) info args
    (gdb) info variables <- All variables in scope

9. How do you quit out of gdb?
    (gdb) quit
    (gdb) q
